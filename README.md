# Byte Thinkers - API Trivia Website

### 📄 Project Overview

Computer Trivia is a simple, interactive website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Developed as part of Lasallian Codespace Capstone 3, this is a solo project that demonstrates practical use of API and dynamic content rendering with vanilla JavaScript.

The website fetches random computer-related trivia from a public API and displays it to the user in an engaging, easy-to-read format. Each button click provides a new fact, making it a fun and educational tool for anyone interested in computers and technology.
